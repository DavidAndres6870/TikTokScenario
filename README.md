# TikTokScenary
## Course 3 workplace scenario
**Project goal:**

The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

**Background:**

TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content–where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

**Scenario:**

It is now time to begin the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA). As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, you will complete the EDA process for the claims classification project. You’ll also use Tableau to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data.

**Course 3 tasks:**

- Imports of relevant packages and TikTok data into Python
- EDA and cleaning
- Assess Tableau measures and dimensions
- Select and build visualization(s) type
- Create plots to visualize variables and relationships between variables
- Share your results with the TikTok team
